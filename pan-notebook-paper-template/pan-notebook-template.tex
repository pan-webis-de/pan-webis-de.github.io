\section{Introduction}

CEUR-WS's article template provides a consistent \LaTeX{} style for
use across CEUR-WS publications, and incorporates accessibility and
metadata-extraction functionality. This document will explain the
major features of the document class.

If you are new to publishing with CEUR-WS, this document is a valuable
guide to the process of preparing your work for publication.

The ``\verb|ceurart|'' document class can be used to prepare articles
for any CEUR-WS publication, and for any stage of publication, from
review to final ``camera-ready'' copy with {\itshape very} few changes
to the source.

\section{Mandatory Citations}

\begin{itemize}
\item To cite the PAN lab 2025, please use \cite{bevendorff:2025}
\item To cite TIRA, please use \cite{froebe:2023b}
\end{itemize}

More and updated citations will be sent to authors before submission of the final version. Please make sure to update them accordingly.

\section{Use of This Template}

The sources for the most up-to-date version of the ceur-art style are available via
\begin{itemize}
\item \href{https://github.com/yamadharma/ceurart}{GitHub},
\item \href{https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-submissions-to-ceur-workshop-proceedings-ceur-ws-dot-org/pkfscdkgkhcq}{Overleaf}.
\end{itemize}

Modifying the template --- including but not limited to: adjusting
margins, typeface sizes, line spacing, paragraph and list definitions,
and the use of the \verb|\vspace| command to manually adjust the
vertical spacing between elements of your work --- is not allowed.

\section{Template parameters}

There are a number of template
parameters which modify some part of the \verb|ceurart| document class.
This parameters are enclosed in square
brackets and are a part of the \verb|\documentclass| command:
\begin{verbatim}
  \documentclass[parameter]{ceurart}
\end{verbatim}

Frequently-used parameters, or combinations of parameters, include:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|twocolumn| : Two column layout.
\item \verb|hf| : Enable header and footer\footnote{You can enable
    the display of page numbers in the final version of the entire
    collection. In this case, you should adhere to the end-to-end
    pagination of individual papers.}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Front matter}

\subsection{Title Information}

The titles of papers should be either all use the emphasizing
capitalized style or they should all use the regular English (or
native language) style. It does not make a good impression if you or
your authors mix the styles.

Use the \verb|\title| command to define the title of your work. Do not
insert line breaks in your title.

\subsection{Title variants}

\verb|\title| command have the below options:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|title|: Document title. This is default option. 
\begin{verbatim}
\title[mode=title]{This is a title}
\end{verbatim}
You can just omit it, like as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
\title{This is a title}
\end{verbatim}

\item \verb|alt|: Alternate title.
\begin{verbatim}
\title[mode=alt]{This is a alternate title}
\end{verbatim}

\item \verb|sub|: Sub title.
\begin{verbatim}
\title[mode=sub]{This is a sub title}
\end{verbatim}
You can just use \verb|\subtitle| command, as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
\subtitle{This is a sub title}
\end{verbatim}

\item \verb|trans|: Translated title.
\begin{verbatim}
\title[mode=trans]{This is a translated title}
\end{verbatim}

\item \verb|transsub|: Translated sub title.
\begin{verbatim}
\title[mode=transsub]{This is a translated sub title}
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Authors and Affiliations}

Each author must be defined separately for accurate metadata
identification. Multiple authors may share one affiliation. Authors'
names should not be abbreviated; use full first names wherever
possible. Include authors' e-mail addresses whenever possible.

\verb|\author| command have the below options: 

\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|style| : Style of author name (chinese)
\item \verb|prefix| : Prefix
\item \verb|suffix| : Suffix
\item \verb|degree| : Degree
\item \verb|role| : Role
\item \verb|orcid| : ORCID
\item \verb|email| : E-mail
\item \verb|url| : URL
\end{itemize}

Author names can have some kinds of marks and notes:
\begin{itemize}
\item affiliation mark: \verb|\author[<num>]|.
\end{itemize}

The author names and affiliations could be formatted in two ways:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Group the authors per affiliation.
\item Use an explicit mark to indicate the affiliations.
\end{enumerate}

Author block example:
\begin{verbatim}
\author[1,2]{Author Name}[%
    prefix=Prof.,
    degree=D.Sc.,
    role=Researcher,
    orcid=0000-0000-000-0000,
    email=name@example.com,
    url=https://name.example.com
]

\address[1]{Affiliation #1}
\address[2]{Affiliation #2}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Abstract and Keywords}

Abstract shall be entered in an environment that starts
with \verb|\begin{abstract}| and ends with
\verb|\end{abstract}|. 

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{abstract}
  This is an abstract.
\end{abstract}
\end{verbatim}

The key words are enclosed in a \verb|keywords|
environment. Use \verb|\sep| to separate keywords.

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{keywords}
  First keyword \sep 
  Second keyword \sep 
  Third keyword \sep 
  Fourth keyword
\end{keywords}
\end{verbatim}

At the end of front matter add \verb|\maketitle| command.

\subsection{Various Marks in the Front Matter}

The front matter becomes complicated due to various kinds
of notes and marks to the title and author names. Marks in
the title will be denoted by a star ($\star$) mark;
footnotes are denoted by super scripted Arabic numerals,
corresponding author by an Conformal asterisk (*) mark.

\subsubsection{Title marks}

Title mark can be entered by the command, \verb|\tnotemark[<num>]|
and the corresponding text can be entered with the command
\verb|\tnotetext[<num>]{<text>}|. An example will be:

\begin{verbatim}
\title{A better way to format your document for CEUR-WS}

\tnotemark[1]
\tnotetext[1]{You can use this document as the template for preparing your
  publication. We recommend using the latest version of the ceurart style.}
\end{verbatim}

\verb|\tnotemark| and \verb|\tnotetext| can be anywhere in
the front matter, but should be before \verb|\maketitle| command.

\subsubsection{Author marks}

Author names can have some kinds of marks and notes:
\begin{itemize}
\item footnote mark : \verb|\fnmark[<num>]|
\item footnote text : \verb|\fntext[<num>]{<text>}|
\item corresponding author mark : \verb|\cormark[<num>]|
\item corresponding author text : \verb|\cortext[<num>]{<text>}|
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Other marks}

At times, authors want footnotes which leave no marks in
the author names. The note text shall be listed as part of
the front matter notes. Class files provides
\verb|\nonumnote| for this purpose. The usage
\begin{verbatim}
\nonumnote{<text>}
\end{verbatim}
and should be entered anywhere before the \verb|\maketitle|
command for this to take effect. 

\section{Sectioning Commands}

Your work should use standard \LaTeX{} sectioning commands:
\verb|\section|, \verb|\subsection|,
\verb|\subsubsection|, and
\verb|\paragraph|. They should be numbered; do not remove
the numbering from the commands.

Simulating a sectioning command by setting the first word or words of
a paragraph in boldface or italicized text is not allowed.

\section{Tables}

The ``\verb|ceurart|'' document class includes the ``\verb|booktabs|''
package --- \url{https://ctan.org/pkg/booktabs} --- for preparing
high-quality tables.

Table captions are placed \textit{above} the table.

Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best placement for
them is typically the top of the page nearest their initial cite.  To
ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
environment \verb|table| to enclose the table's contents and the
table caption. The contents of the table itself must go in the
\verb|tabular| environment, to be aligned properly in rows and
columns, with the desired horizontal and vertical rules.

Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table~\ref{tab:freq} is included in the input file; compare the
placement of the table here with the table in the printed output of
this document.

\begin{table*}
  \caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
  \label{tab:freq}
  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
    \toprule
    Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\
    \midrule
    \O & 1 in 1,000& For Swedish names\\
    $\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\
    \$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\
    $\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table*}

To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of the page's
live area, use the environment \verb|table*| to enclose the table's
contents and the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this
wide table will ``float'' to a location deemed more
desirable. Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table~\ref{tab:commands} is included in the input file; again, it is
instructive to compare the placement of the table here with the table
in the printed output of this document.

\begin{table}
  \caption{Some Typical Commands}
  \label{tab:commands}
  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
    \toprule
    Command &A Number & Comments\\
    \midrule
    \texttt{{\char'134}author} & 100& Author \\
    \texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\
    \texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Math Equations}

You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:
inline, numbered or non-numbered display.  Each of the three are
discussed in the next sections.

\subsection{Inline (In-text) Equations}

A formula that appears in the running text is called an inline or
in-text formula.  It is produced by the \verb|math| environment,
which can be invoked with the usual
\verb|\begin| \ldots \verb|\end| construction or with
the short form \verb|$| \ldots \verb|$|. You can use any of the symbols
and structures, from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in
\LaTeX;
this section will simply show a few
examples of in-text equations in context. Notice how this equation:
\begin{math}
  \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{n} = 0,
\end{math}
set here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when
set in display style.  (See next section).

\subsection{Display Equations}

A numbered display equation---one set off by vertical space from the
text and centered horizontally---is produced by the \verb|equation|
environment. An unnumbered display equation is produced by the
\verb|displaymath| environment.

Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols and
structures available in \LaTeX{}; this section will just give a couple
of examples of display equations in context.  First, consider the
equation, shown as an inline equation above:
\begin{equation}
  \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{n} = 0.
\end{equation}
Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in
the \verb|displaymath|
environment.  Now, we'll enter an unnumbered equation:
\begin{displaymath}
  S_{n} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i} ,
\end{displaymath}
and follow it with another numbered equation:
\begin{equation}
  \lim_{x \to 0} (1 + x)^{1/x} = e
\end{equation}
just to demonstrate \LaTeX's able handling of numbering.


\section{Citations and Bibliographies}

The use of Bib\TeX{} for the preparation and formatting of one's
references is strongly recommended. Authors' names should be complete
--- use full first names (``Donald E. Knuth'') not initials
(``D. E. Knuth'') --- and the salient identifying features of a
reference should be included: title, year, volume, number, pages,
article DOI, etc.

The bibliography is included in your source document with these two
commands, placed just before the \verb|\end{document}|
command:
\begin{verbatim}
\bibliography{bibfile}
\end{verbatim}
where ``\verb|bibfile|'' is the name, without the ``\verb|.bib|''
suffix, of the Bib\TeX{} file.


\section{Acknowledgments}

Identification of funding sources and other support, and thanks to
individuals and groups that assisted in the research and the
preparation of the work should be included in an acknowledgment
section, which is placed just before the reference section in your
document.

This section has a special environment:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{acknowledgments}
  These are different acknowledgments.
\end{acknowledgments}
\end{verbatim}
so that the information contained therein can be more easily collected
during the article metadata extraction phase, and to ensure
consistency in the spelling of the section heading.

Authors should not prepare this section as a numbered or unnumbered
\verb|\section|; please use the ``\verb|acknowledgments|'' environment.

\section{Appendices}

If your work needs an appendix, add it before the
``\verb|\end{document}|'' command at the conclusion of your source
document.

Start the appendix with the ``\verb|\appendix|'' command:
\begin{verbatim}
\appendix
\end{verbatim}
and note that in the appendix, sections are lettered, not
numbered. 

%%
%% The acknowledgments section is defined using the "acknowledgments" environment
%% (and NOT an unnumbered section). This ensures the proper
%% identification of the section in the article metadata, and the
%% consistent spelling of the heading.
