            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>Many approaches have been proposed recently to identify <i>the</i> author of a given document.
                Thereby, one fact
                is often silently assumed: i.e., that the given document is indeed written by only author.
                For a realistic author identification system it is therefore crucial to at first determine
                whether a document
                is single- or multiauthored.</p>
            <p>To this end, previous PAN editions aimed to analyze multi-authored documents. As it has been
                shown that it is a
                hard problem to reliably identify individual authors and their contribution within a single
                document
                (<a href="../../clef16/pan16-web/author-clustering.html">Author Diarization, 2016</a>;
                <a href="../../clef17/pan17-web/author-clustering.html">Style Breach Detection, 2017</a>),
                last year's
                task substantially relaxed the problem by asking only for binary decision (single- or
                multi-authored).
                Considering the promising results achieved by the submitted approaches (see the
                <a href="http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2125/invited_paper_2.pdf">overview paper</a> for details), we
                continue last year's
                task and additionally ask participants to predict the number of involved authors.</p>

            <p>Given a document, participants thus should apply intrinsic style analyses to hierarchically
                answer
                the following questions:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Is the document written by one or more authors, i.e., do style changes exist or not?</li>
                <li>If it is multi-authored, how many authors have collaborated?</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The following figure illustrates some possible scenarios and the expected output:</p>
            <img src="../pan19-figures/style-change-detection-19-example.png"
                 alt="Style Change Detection Example">

            <p>Note that it is irrelevant to identify the number of style changes or the specific positions
                where the authorships change.</p>

            <h2 id="task">Task</h2>
            <p>Given a document, determine whether it contains style changes or not, i.e., if it was written by
                a single or multiple authors. If it is written by more than one author, determine the number of
                involved collaborators.</p>
            <p>All documents are provided in English and may contain zero up to arbitrarily many style
                changes, resulting from arbitrarily many authors.</p>

            <h2 id="data">Development Phase</h2>
            <p>To develop your algorithms, a data set including corresponding solutions is provided (<i>download
                will be available soon)</i>:</p>
            <ul class="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
                <li>a <strong>training</strong> set: contains 50% of the whole dataset and includes solutions.
                    Use this set to feed/train your models.
                </li>
                <li>a <strong>validation</strong> set: contains 25% of the whole dataset and includes solutions.
                    Use this set to evaluate and optimize your models.
                </li>
                <li>a <strong>test</strong> set: contains 25% of the whole dataset and does not include
                    solutions. This set is used for evaluation (see later).
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Like last year, the whole data set is based on user posts from various sites of the
                <a href="https://stackexchange.com">StackExchange network</a>, covering different topics and
                containing approximately 300 to 2000 tokens per document.</p>

            <p>For each problem instance X, two files are provided:
            <ul class="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
                <li><code>problem-X.txt</code> contains the actual text</li>
                <li><code>problem-X.truth</code> contains the ground truth, i.e., the correct solution in
                    <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> format:
                    <pre class="prettyprint"><code class="lang-json">{
    "authors": number_of_authors,
    "structure": [author_segment_1, ..., author_segment_3],
    "switches": [
        character_pos_switch_segment_1, ...,
        character_pos_switch_segment_n,
    ]
}</code></pre>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>An example for a multi-author document could look as follows:</p>
            <pre class="prettyprint"><code class="lang-json">{
	"authors": 4,
	"structure": ["A1", "A2", "A4", "A2", "A4", "A2", "A3", "A2", "A4"],
	"switches": [805, 1552, 2827, 3584, 4340, 5489, 7564, 8714]
}</code></pre>
            <p>whereas a single-author document would have exactly the following form:</p>
            <pre class="prettyprint"><code class="lang-json">{
	"authors": 1,
	"structure": ["A1"],
	"switches": []
}</code></pre>

            <p>Note that authors within the <i>structure</i> correspond only to the respective document, i.e., they are not the same over the whole dataset. For example, author <i>A1</i> in
                document 1 is most likely <strong>not</strong> the same author as <i>A1</i> in document 2 (it <strong>could</strong> be, but as there are hundreds of authors the chances are
                very small that this is the case). Further, please consider that the structure and the <i>switches</i> are provided only as additional
                resources for the development of your algorithms, i.e., they are <strong>not expected to be
                    predicted</strong>.</p>


            <p>To tackle the problem, you can develop novel approaches, extend existing algorithms from last
                year's task or
                adapt approaches from related problems such as <b>intrinsic plagiarism detection</b> or <b>text
                    segmentation</b>.
                You are also free to additionally evaluate your approaches on last year's
                training/validation/test dataset
                (for the number of authors use the corresponding meta data).</p>
            <h2>Evaluation Phase</h2>
            <p>Once you finished tuning your approach to achieve satisfying performance on the training corpus,
                your software will be tested on the evaluation corpus (test data set). You can expect the test
                data
                set to be similar to the validation data set, i.e., also based on StackExchange user posts and
                of
                similar size as the validation set. During the competition, the evaluation corpus will not be
                released publicly. Instead, we ask you to <strong>submit your software</strong> for evaluation
                at
                our site as described below.</p>
            <p>After the competition, the evaluation corpus will become available including ground truth data.
                This way, you have all the necessities to evaluate your approach on your own, yet being
                comparable
                to those who took part in the competition.</p>

            <h2 id="output">Output</h2>
            <p>In general, the data structure during the evaluation phase will be similar to that in the
                training phase, with the exception that the ground truth files are missing.</p>

            <p>For each given problem
                <code>problem-X.txt</code> your software should output the missing solution file
                <code>problem-X.truth</code>, containing a JSON object with <strong>a single property</strong>:
            </p>

            <pre class="prettyprint"><code class="lang-json">{
    "authors": number_of_authors
}</code></pre>

            <h2  id="performance-measures">Performance Measures</h2>
            <p>The performance of the submitted approaches will be ranked by a combined measure incorporating
                both the
                accuracy of distinguishing single- from multi-author documents and the correctness of the
                predicted number of authors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>accuracy</strong> will measure the performance of correctly separating single-author
                    (1 author) from multi-author (> 1 author) documents
                </li>
                <li>The <strong>Ordinal Classification Index (OCI)</strong> will be used to measure the error of
                    predicting the number of authors <strong>for multi-author documents</strong> (i.e., only for
                    multi-author documents and not for single-author documents). OCI has been proposed by
                    Cardoso and Sousa in their paper <i>Measuring the performance of ordinal classification</i>.
                    It is computed directly from the confusion matrix and yields a value between 0 and 1, being
                    0 the best value (perfect prediction).
                </li>
                <li>The <strong>final ranking</strong> is finally computed as the average of the classification
                    accuracy and the (inverted) OCI score:
                    $$ \text{rank} = {\text{accuracy} + (1-\text{OCI}) \over {2}} $$
                </li>
            </ul>


            <h2 id="submission">Submission</h2>
            <p>We ask you to prepare your software so that it can be executed via command line calls. The
                command shall take as input (i) an absolute path to the directory of the evaluation corpus and
                (ii) an absolute path to an empty output directory:</p>
            <pre class="prettyprint"><code class="lang-cmd">mySoftware -i EVALUATION-DIRECTORY -o OUTPUT-DIRECTORY</code></pre>

            <p>Within <code>EVALUATION-DIRECTORY</code>, you will find a list of problem instances, i.e., <code>[filename].txt</code>
                files.
                For each problem instance you should produce the solution file <code>[filename].truth</code> in
                the <code>OUTPUT-DIRECTORY</code> For instance, you read <code>EVALUATION-DIRECTORY/problem-12.txt</code>,
                process it and write your results to <code>OUTPUT-DIRECTORY/problem-12.truth</code>.</p>

            <p>In general, this task follows PAN's software submission strategy described <a
