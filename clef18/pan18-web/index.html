                        <p>In this talk I will review some recent results regarding early detection
                            of signs of
                            depression and anorexia. Since 2017, we have been organizing eRisk, a CLEF lab that
                            promotes the development of effective and efficient solutions for early risk prediction
                            on the Internet. eRisk explores the evaluation methodology, effectiveness metrics and
                            practical applications (particularly those related to health and safety) of early risk
                            detection on the Internet. Early detection technologies can be employed in different
                            areas, particularly those related to health and safety. For instance, early alerts could
                            be sent when a predator starts interacting with a child for sexual purposes, or when a
                            potential offender starts publishing antisocial threats on a blog, forum or social
                            network. Our main goal is to pioneer a new interdisciplinary research area that would be
                            potentially applicable to a wide variety of situations and to many different personal
                            profiles. Examples include potential paedophiles, stalkers, individuals that could fall
                            into the hands of criminal organisations, people with suicidal inclinations, or people
                            susceptible to depression. In this talk, I will discuss the lessons learned over these
                            two years and some future lines of work.

                                <p>Dr. David E. Losada is an Associate Professor in Computer Science & Artificial
                                    Intelligence at the University of Santiago de Compostela (Spain). He is currently the
                                    Director of the Master's Programme on Big Data Analytics. David E. Losada received his BS in
                                    Computer Science (with honors) in 1997, and his PhD in Computer Science (with
                                    honors) in 2001, both from the University of A Coruña (Spain). From 2001 to 2002, he was
                                    a lecturer in the San Pablo-CEU University (Spain) and, in 2003, he joined the Univ. of
                                    Santiago de Compostela as a senior research fellow ("Ramón y Cajal" R&D programme). His
                                    current research interests include a wide range of Information Retrieval (IR) and
                                    related areas such as: early risk detection, text mining, IR evaluation, IR
                                    probabilistic models, summarization, novelty detection, and sentence retrieval. Losada
                                    is an active member of the IR community and he regularly serves in the Programme
                                    Committee of prestigious international conferences such as SIGIR or ECIR. He has also
                                    led several R&D projects and contracts in the area of search technologies. In 2011,
                                    Losada was recognized with an ACM senior member award. David started the organization of
                                    eRisk in 2017. eRisk is a CLEF lab that promotes the development of effective and
                                    efficient solutions for early risk prediction on the Internet.</p>

                        <p>The drastic change in the Web was witnessed throughout the past decade,
                            which saw an
                            exponential growth in social networking services. Traditionally, social network users
                            are encouraged to complete their profiles by explicitly providing their personal
                            attributes such as age, gender, interests, etc. Such information is essential for
                            Marketing, Facility Arrangement, or Candidate Assessment, but, unfortunately, often not
                            publicly available. This gives rise to user profiling, which aims at automatic inference
                            of individual user attributes based on their social network interactions. Considering
                            that human beings frequently contribute multi-modal data in multiple online social
                            networks at the same time, it is essential to implement inter-source complimentary
                            multi-view learning techniques to perform automatic user profiling efficiently. In this
                            talk, we will overview recent research attempts on learning across multiple social
                            networks and data modalities for automatic user profiling. We will also give several
                            practical examples of how Multi-View User Profiling helps SoMin.ai in boosting the
                            efficiency of enterprises' marketing efforts.</p>

                        <p>There is much concern about algorithms that underlie information
                            services and the view of
                            the social world they present to users. Image search engines are known to perpetuate
                            gender stereotypes, particularly surrounding professions (e.g., returning primarily
                            images of men on a search for "engineer," although few, if any, men on a search for
                            "nurse"). In the first part of the talk, I discuss the problem of detecting social
                            biases in image search results. We developed a novel method for automatically examining
                            the content and strength of gender stereotypes in image results, which is inspired by
                            the trait adjective checklist method. In experiments with Microsoft Bing, we found that
                            photos of women are more often retrieved for searches on warm character traits (e.g.,
                            "emotional"), whereas agentic traits (e.g., "rational") typically result in more images
                            of men. In the second part of the talk, I address questions surrounding the origin of
                            social biases in search algorithms. I will argue that the quality of image metadata is a
                            source of bias, as algorithms are typically trained on "gold standard," human-produced
                            metadata. Specifically, in an experiment testing a commonly used crowdsourcing task for
                            metadata generation, I will provide evidence that people's descriptions of men and women
                            depicted in similar contexts differ in systematic ways that are predictable by theory.
                            In conclusion, I shall argue that while the reproduction of social stereotypes in search
                            algorithms is likely inevitable, there are ways to effectively raise users' awareness of
                            biases in results.</p>
