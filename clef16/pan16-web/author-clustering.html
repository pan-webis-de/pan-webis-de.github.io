            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>Authorship attribution is an important problem in information retrieval and computational
                        linguistics but also in applied areas such as law and journalism where knowing the author of a
                        document (such as a ransom note) may be able to save lives. The most common framework for
                        testing candidate algorithms is the closed-set attribution task: given known sample documents
                        from a small, finite set of candidate authors, which wrote a questioned document of unknown
                        authorship? It has been commented, however, that this may be an unreasonably easy task. A more
                        demanding task is <strong>author clustering</strong> where given a document collection the task
                        is to group documents written by the same author so that each cluster corresponds to a different
                        author. This task can also be viewed as establishing <strong>authorship links</strong> between
                        documents. </p>
                    <p>Note that a variation of author clustering was included in the PAN-2012 edition. However, it was
                        focused on the paragraph-level and therefore it is more related to the author diarization task
                        (see details in the right column). In PAN-2016, we focus on <strong>document-level author
                            clustering</strong>. The task of authorship verification studied in detail in previous
                        editions of PAN (2013-2015) is strongly associated with author clustering since any clustering
                        problem can be decomposed into a series of author verification problems. We encourage
                        participants to attempt to modify authorship verification approaches to deal with the author
                        clustering task.</p>
                    <p>In this edition of PAN we aim to study two application scenarios: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Complete author clustering</strong>: This scenario requires a detailed analysis
                            where the number (k) of different authors found in the collection should be identified and
                            each document should be assigned to exactly one of the k clusters (each cluster corresponds
                            to a different author). In the following illustrating example, 4 different authors are found
                            and the colour of each document indicates its author.
                        </li>
                        <center>
                            <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15824066/12065874/81d95440-afe7-11e5-828b-54e293540823.png"/>
                        </center>
                        <li><strong>Authorship-link ranking</strong>: This scenario views the exploration of the given
                            document collection as a retrieval task. It aims at establishing authorship links between
                            documents and provides a list of document pairs ranked according to a confidence score (the
                            score shows how likely it is the document pair to be by the same author). In the following
                            example, 4 document pairs with similar authorship are found and then these authorship-links
                            are sorted according to their similarity.
                        </li>
                        <center>
                            <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15824066/12065971/f2a087e2-afe8-11e5-9ef4-6df4e5aff9ae.png"/>
                        </center>
                    </ul>


            <h2 id="task">Task</h2>
            <p>Given a collection of (up to 100) documents, identify authorship links and groups of documents by
                the same author. All documents are single-authored, in the same language, and belong to the same
                genre. However, the topic or text-length of documents may vary. The number of distinct authors
                whose documents are included in the collection is not given.</p>

            <h2 id="data">Development Phase</h2>
            <p>To develop your software, we provide you with a training corpus that comprises a set of author
                clustering problems in <strong>3 languages</strong> (English, Dutch, and Greek) and <strong>2
                    genres</strong> (newspaper articles and reviews). Each problem consists of a set of
                documents in the same language and genre. However, their topic may differ and the document
                lengths vary from a few hundred to a few thousand words.</p>
            <p>The documents of each problem are located in a separate folder. The file <code>info.json</code>
                describes all required information for each clustering problem. In more detail, the language
                (either <code>"en"</code>, <code>"nl"</code>, or <code>"gr"</code> for English, Dutch and Greek,
                respectively), genre (either <code>"articles"</code> or <code>"reviews"</code>), and the folder
                of each problem (relative path).</p>
            <pre class="prettyprint lang-py" style="overflow-x:auto">
[
   {"language": "en", "genre": "articles", "folder": "problem001"},
   ...
]
</pre>
            <p>The ground truth data of the training corpus consists of two files for each clustering problem:
                <code>clustering.json</code> and <code>ranking.json</code> similar to the files described in the
                <strong>Output</strong> section (see details below). All ground truth files are located in the
                <code>truth</code> folder.</p>

            <h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation Phase</h2>
             <p>Once you finished tuning your approach to achieve satisfying performance on the training corpus,
                your software will be tested on the evaluation corpus. During the competition, the evaluation
                corpus will not be released publicly. Instead, we ask you to <strong>submit your software</strong> for
                evaluation at our site as described below.</p>
            <p>After the competition, the evaluation corpus will become available including ground truth data.
                This way, you have all the necessities to evaluate your approach on your own, yet being
                comparable to those who took part in the competition.</p>


            <h2 id="output">Output</h2>
            <p>Your system should produce <strong>two output files</strong> in <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a>:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>One output file including complete information about the detected clusters named <code>clustering.json</code>.
                    Each cluster should contain all documents found in the collection by a specific author. A
                    JSON file of the following format should be produced (a list of clusters, each cluster is a
                    list of documents):
                <li>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-py" style="overflow-x:auto">
[
	[
		{"document":  "filename1"},
		{"document":  "filename2"},
	…
	],
…
]
</pre>

                    <p>The clusters should be non-overlapping, thus each filename should belong to exactly one
                        cluster.</p>

                <li>One output file named <code>ranking.json</code> including a list of document pairs ranked
                    according to a real-valued score in [0,1], where higher values denote more confidence that
                    the pair of documents are by the same author. A JSON file of the following format should be
                    produced (a list of document pairs and a real-valued number):
                </li>
                <pre class="prettyprint lang-py" style="overflow-x:auto">
[
	{"document1": "filename1",
	 "document2": "filename2",
	 "score": real-valued-number},
	…
]
</pre>
                <p>The order of documents within a pair is not important (e.g. "document1": "filename1",
                    "document2": "filename2" is the same with "document2": "filename1",
                    "document1": "filename2"). In case the same pair is reported more than once the first
                    occurrence will be taken into account.</p>
            </ul>

            <p>An <strong>illustrating example</strong> follows. Let’s assume that a document collection of 6
                files is given: file1.txt, file2.txt, file3.txt, file4.txt, file5.txt, and file6.txt. There are
                3 clusters: (i) file1.txt, file3.txt, and file4.txt are by the same author, (ii) file5.txt and
                file6.txt are by another author and (iii) file2.txt is by yet another author. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The output file in JSON for the complete author clustering task should be:</li>
                <pre class="prettyprint lang-py" style="overflow-x:auto">
[   [	{"document": "file1.txt"},
		{"document": "file3.txt"},
		{"document": "file4.txt"}	],
	[
		{"document": "file5.txt"},
		{"document": "file6.txt"}	],
	[
		{"document": "file2.txt"}	]
]
</pre>
                        <li>An example of the output file for authorship-link ranking could be:</li>
                        <pre class="prettyprint lang-py" style="overflow-x:auto">
[	{"document1": "file1.txt",
	 "document2": "file4.txt",
	 "score": 0.95},

	{"document1": "file3.txt",
	 "document2": "file4.txt",
	 "score": 0.75},

	{"document1": "file5.txt",
	 "document2": "file6.txt",
	 "score": 0.66},

	{"document1": "file1.txt",
	 "document2": "file3.txt",
	 "score": 0.63}
]
</pre>
                    </ul>


            <h2 id="performance-measures">Performance Measures</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The clustering output will be evaluated according to <strong>BCubed F-score</strong> (<a
                        href="http://nlp.uned.es/docs/amigo2007a.pdf">Amigo et al. 2007</a>)
                </li>
                <li>The ranking of authorship links will be evaluated according to <strong>Mean Average
                    Precision</strong> (<a
                        href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/evaluation-of-ranked-retrieval-results-1.html">Manning

                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>For your convenience, we provide an evaluator script written in Octave.</p>
            <p>It takes three parameters: (-i) an input directory (the data set including a 'truth' folder),
                (-a) an answers directory (your software output) and (-o) an output directory where the
                evaluation results are written to. Of course, you are free to modify the script according to
                your needs.</p>
