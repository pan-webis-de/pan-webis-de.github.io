            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>The term <i>author diarization</i> originates from the research field <strong>speaker
                diarization</strong>, where approaches try to automatically identify and cluster different
                speakers of an audio speech signal like a telephone conversation or a political TV debate by
                processing and analyzing the audio frequency signal (an overview of approaches can be found, for
                example, <a href="http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~vinyals/Files/taslp2011a.pdf">here</a>).</p>
            <p>Similar to such approaches, the task of <strong>author diarization</strong> in this PAN edition
                is to identify different authors within a single document. Such documents may be the result of a
                collaborative work (e.g., a combined master thesis written by two students, a scientific paper
                written by four authors, …), or the result of plagiarism. The latter is thereby a special case,
                where it can be assumed that the main text is written by one author and only some fragments are
                by other writers (the plagiarized or intrusive sections). On the other hand, the contributions
                of a collaboratively written document may be equally weighted, i.e., each author contributes to
                the same extent.</p>

            <h2 id="task">Task</h2>
            <p>Given a document, identify and group text fragments that correspond to individual authors.
                Similarly to the situation in speaker diarization approaches, where active speakers may change
                at any time, you cannot assume that changes in authorship occur, for example, only on paragraph
                boundaries. But you should rather be prepared to detect different authors at any text position.
                An example could be as follows:</p>

             <p style="margin-left:30px"><i>"<span style="color:RoyalBlue">She is also a successful businesswoman and an American icon,</span><span
                            style="color:red"> was born in Jersey City to middle-class Polish-American parents and she earned a partial scholarship to …</span>"</i>
                    </p>

                    <p>Nevertheless, you may use paragraph boundaries or other useful metrics as heuristic to potential
                        changes.</p>

                    <p>To cover different variants of the problem, the task of this years PAN edition is split into
                        three subproblems. For this year’s edition, all documents are provided in English.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><p><strong>Traditional intrinsic plagiarism detection</strong>: here, you can assume that
                            there exists one main author who wrote at least 70% of the text. Up to the other 30% may be
                            written by other authors. For this problem, you should build exactly two clusters: one
                            containing the text fragments of the main author, and the other one containing the intrusive
                            fragments. </p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>Diarization with a given number (n) of authors</strong>: given a document, the
                            task is to build exactly n clusters containing the contributions of the different writers.
                            Thereby, each author may have contributed to an arbitrary, but non-zero extent.</p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>Diarization with an unknown number of authors</strong>: finally, this variant
                            covers the most challenging task, which is similar to the previous task, but without the
                            information of knowing how many authors contributed to the document.</p></li>
                    </ul>

            <h2 id="input">Input</h2>
            <p>The data set consists of three folders corresponding to each subtask. For each problem instance X
                in each subtask, three files are provided:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>problem-X.txt</code> contains the actual text</li>
                <li><code>problem-X.meta</code> contains meta information about the file in <a
                        href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> format. It contains the<code>"language"</code>
                    (which is always <strong>English</strong> this year), the problem <code>"type"</code>
                    (<code>"plagiarism"</code> or <code>"diarization"</code>) and for the diarization problem
                    with given number of authors additionally the correct number of authors
                    (<code>"numAuthors"</code>)
                </li>
                <li><code>problem-X.truth</code> contains the ground truth, i.e., the correct solution in <a
                        href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> format:
                    <pre class="prettyprint lang-py" style="overflow-x:auto">
{
    "authors": [
        [
            {"from": fromCharPosition,
            "to": toCharPosition},
            …
        ],
        …
    ]
}
</pre>

                    <p>
                        To identify the text fragments, the absolute character start/end positions within the
                        document are used, whereby the document starts at character position 0.</p>

                    <p>
                        Note that for simplicity reasons the solutions for the <strong>intrinsic plagiarism
                        task</strong> contains exactly 2 clusters: one for the main author and one combined for
                        all other authors. Nevertheless, when producing the output, you are free to create as
                        many clusters as you wish for the plagiarized sections.
                    </p>

                    <p>An example for an <strong>intrinsic plagiarism detection solution</strong> could look
                        like this:
                    <pre class="prettyprint lang-py" style="overflow-x:auto">
{
	"authors": [
		[
			{"from": 314, "to": 15769}
		],
		[
			{"from": 0, "to": 313},
			{"from": 15770, "to": 19602}
		]
	]
}
</pre>

                    An example of the <strong>diarization solution</strong> of a document that was written by
                    four authors could then look like this:</p>
                    <pre class="prettyprint lang-py" style="overflow-x:auto">
{
    "authors": [
        [
            {"from": 123, "to": 400},
            {"from": 598, "to": 680}
        ],
        [
            {"from": 0, "to": 122}
        ],
        [
            {"from": 401, "to": 597},
            {"from": 681, "to": 1020},
            {"from": 1101, "to": 1400}
        ],
        [
            {"from": 1021, "to": 1100}
        ]
    ]
}
</pre>

                    <p>Of course, in the actual evaluation phase the ground truth, i.e., the <code>problem-X.truth</code>
                        file will be missing.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="output">Output</h2>
            <p>
                In general, the data structure during the evaluation phase will be similar to that in the
                training phase, with the exception that the ground truth files are missing.
                This means, you can also use the information provided in the <code>problem-X.meta</code> file.
                Your software should finally output the missing solution file <code>problem-X.truth</code> for
                every problem instance X in the respective output folder (see Submission). The output syntax
                should thereby be exactly like it is used in the training phase.
            </p>

            <p>In general, there is no difference in the output between the intrinisic plagiarism detection and
                the diarization subtasks. Moreover, the <strong>order</strong> of the entries is <strong>not
                    relevant</strong>.
            <p>In the following, we provide you with some examples for both subtasks:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        For the <strong>intrinsic plagiarism detection</strong> subtask, you should create one
                        entry for the main author. For the plagiarized sections you are free to either combine
                        them into one entry (like it is done in the training data) or split them into more
                        entries. As an example, if you found 2 plagiarized sections in the file <code>problem-3.txt</code>,
                        you should produce the file <code>problem-3.truth</code>, where both</p>

                    To evaluate the quality of the intrinsic plagiarism detection algorithms, the <strong>micro-
                    and macro-averaged F-score</strong> will be used
                    (see <a href="https://webis.de/publications.html#?q=stein_2010p">this paper</a>).

            <h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>

            Once you finished tuning your approach to achieve satisfying performance on the training corpus,
            your software will be tested on the evaluation corpus. During the competition, the evaluation corpus
            will not be released publicly. Instead, we ask you to <strong>submit your software</strong> for
            evaluation at our site as described below.
            <br>After the competition, the evaluation corpus will become available including ground truth data.
            This way, you have all the necessities to evaluate your approach on your own, yet being comparable
            to those who took part in the competition.
